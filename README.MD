### How to execute the code
You may need to install some dependencies. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
To execute the code, you can simply run the project.ipynb, running each cell from top to bottom. Cells are sequential and often depend on previous cells, so make sure to run them sequentially. This notebook will show the 4 simple models. This will take a few minutes because a new neural network will be trained, as well as the other models which don't take as long.


To run the graph neural network models, navigate to molecularGNNN_smiles/main, then run predict.py. This directory is a modified version of https://github.com/masashitsubaki/molecularGNN_smiles?tab=readme-ov-file. There are a few saved pickle models in the molecularGNN_smiles/output folder, which can be swapped out, but I left the most effective one as the default in the main/predict.py. Simply run the predict.py and it will predict values based on the test dataset. To train new models, you can run the train.py after adjusting the hyperparameters, but this can take several minutes to hours, so I would recommend sticking to the default model, unless you're really curious. The default is to use the Kaggle dataset, but if you navigate to the dataset/regression/melting folder, rename the data_bradley_melting_point_dataset.txt to the data_train.txt, and it will run on that dataset, although in my testing performance was worse.
